## Why Moving?
PostgreSQL on this machine has authentication issues. Friend's laptop has properly configured PostgreSQL with correct credentials.

## What's Working ✅
- Frontend UI complete (onboarding flow, dashboard)
- Clerk authentication configured
- Uploadthing integration (callback has dev mode issue but uploads work)
- AI vibe generation with Anthropic Claude
- All API endpoints created
- Build passes successfully

## What Needs Testing 🔧
- Database connection (PostgreSQL password issue on this machine)
- Full end-to-end drop creation flow
- Dashboard with real data

## Next Steps
Continue on friend's laptop with working PostgreSQL setup.
